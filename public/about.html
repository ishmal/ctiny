	<div class="tiny-about">
		<p>
			During the course of a ham radio Morse conversation, the participants
			might wish to exchange URL's to web sites. Sending
			"http://" is painful on CW, so an alternate way seems like a good idea.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is the good idea: shorten the URL to something that is easy to send.
			Only letters, case insensitive, and as few as possible.
			Make the short URL's short-lived, so that the nicer shorter
			codes become available again. And since CW is manual, keep
			the user's necessary actions to a minimum.
		</p>

		<p>
			To make a CTiny URL, paste the real URL into the upper field
			and press Encode. The Tiny code will appear in the other field.
			Yes. it is insanely short. Send that to your friend.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you receive a CTiny code from the other guy, just
			type it into the lower field and hit the Decode button. The URL's page
			will be loaded into another tab.
		</p>

		<p>
			And that is all. I hope that this is useful for you.
