		<h5 class="lead">A URL shortener for Morse code and CW.</h5>

		<div class="tiny-about">

			CTiny codes:
			<ul>
					<li>As short as possible</li>
					<li>Only A to Z and a to z, case insensitive</li>
					<li>Favors easier letters</li>
					<li>URL's last 3 hours</li>
					<li>Old URL's reused</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				During the course of a ham radio Morse conversation, the participants might wish to exchange URL's to web sites. Sending
				"http://" is painful on CW, so an alternate way seems like a good idea.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is the good idea: shorten the URL to something that is easy to send. Only letters, case insensitive, and as few as possible.
				Make the short URL's short-lived, so that the nicer shorter codes become available again. And since CW is manual, keep
				the user's necessary actions to a minimum.
			</p>

			<p>
				To make a CTiny URL, paste the real URL into the upper field and press Encode. The Tiny code will appear in the other field.
				Yes. it is insanely short. Send that to your friend.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you receive a CTiny code from the other guy, just type it into the lower field and hit the Decode button. The URL's
				page will be loaded into another tab.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that is all. This is all for fun. I hope that this is useful for you.
