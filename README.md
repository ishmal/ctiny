# ctiny
URL shortener for people.

This was originally designed for Morse code, but it helps with all URLs that need
to be shared by human channels.  You can shorten the URL here and pass it to another
person with a variety of means:   voice,  a piece of paper. etc.

During the course of a conversation, the participants
might wish to exchange URL's to web sites. Sending
"http://" is painful to communicate, so an alternate way seems like a good idea.

Here is the good idea: shorten the URL to something that is easy to send.
Only letters, case insensitive, and as few as possible.
Make the short URL's short-lived, so that the nicer shorter
codes become available again. And keep
the user's necessary actions to a minimum.

To make a CTiny URL, paste the real URL into the upper field
and press Encode. The Tiny code will appear in the other field.
Yes. it is insanely short. Send that to your friend.

When you receive a CTiny code from the other guy, just
type it into the lower field and hit the Decode button. The URL's page
will be loaded into another tab.
And that is all. I hope that this is useful for you.
